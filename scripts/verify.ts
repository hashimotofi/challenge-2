// This script should be completed by the candidate as part of Task 4
// The goal is to verify the deployment and configuration of the vault contracts

// Helper function to load deployment addresses
// loadDeploymentAddresses() - Load addresses from deployments/plume.json

// Implement a function to check if contracts are deployed correctly
// verifyDeployments(deploymentAddresses) - Should verify that:
// - All contract addresses are present and valid
// - Contracts are deployed at the specified addresses
// - Contracts have the correct bytecode

// Implement a function to validate contract configurations
// validateConfigurations(contracts) - Should verify that:
// - TokenVault has correct manager, distributor, and oracle addresses
// - Proper role assignments are in place
// - Configuration parameters match requirements

// Implement a function to test basic interactions
// testInteractions(contracts) - Should test that:
// - Vault can call reward distributor
// - Price oracle responds to vault queries
// - Vault manager flows function end-to-end

// Implement a function to generate a deployment report
// generateDeploymentReport(deploymentAddresses) - Should:
// - Create a DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md file with deployment details
// - Include contract addresses, verification status, and configuration details
// - Document gas usage and other deployment statistics
// - Provide a health check summary

// Main verification function should:
// 1. Confirm we're on the Plume testnet
// 2. Load the deployment addresses from deployments/plume.json
// 3. Create contract instances using the addresses
// 4. Execute the verification steps:
//    - verifyDeployments()
//    - validateConfigurations()
//    - testInteractions()
// 5. Generate the deployment report

// Make sure to handle errors gracefully and log progress to the console
